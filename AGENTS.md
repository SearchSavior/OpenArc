OpenArc uses bleeding edge libraries and APIs you may not be familair with. When working through a task, use the deepwiki mcp server to get *contextual* information, and the commandl line to investigate python surfaces.

- When making changes, dont worry about backward compatibility; we use git for this.
- Use uv to install dependencies
- Respect existing patterns in the codebase
- When the backend is changed, make sure parameters in the frontend are updated.
- Don't rush, and ask clarifying questions.
