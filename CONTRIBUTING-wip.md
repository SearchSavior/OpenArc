## Code Quality and AI Tools

I have learned coding using AI tools and am not here to judge. Still, we need to define a standard.

AI tools are a fantastic resource, especially for learning more about AI- most of this project was written in natural language and pseudocode in turn-based editing and agents using Cursor. Tab. Tab. Tab.

That said, I review my own generated code line by line to ensure correctness and expect the same level of scrutiny from anyone who contributes to OpenArc. Nothing disqualifies a PR from review, but I ask that you respect my time and everyone elses by working to limit slop. 

### Ground rules for generated code

> [!Note] Check back here before you mark anything as ready for review.
> There are many types of slop,

- Generated omments are not allowed.
- Code documentation should not mention changes.
- Methods, functions, classes snippets should not contain language from instructions.
- 




A solid PR

- Adds something to the project
- Implements a paper
- Refines existing systems

- Maintains literally anything





- Changes should be related to your PR.
