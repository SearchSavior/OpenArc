## Diagnostic: Device Query


Reccomended usage strategies:
    - Driver issues
    - Device access permissions
    - Test Hardware access from containers
    - Python path visibility
    - Proper environment variable configuration 

#### Example use cases:

1. Evaluating conflicting dependencies
    - With careful dependency management you can control hardware across the Intel AI stack.
    - However 


2. Say you need to have PyTorch, IPEX and OpenVINO in one conda env.
    - This test alongside an XPU device query creates useful diagnostic infomration.
